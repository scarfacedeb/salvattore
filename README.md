Salvattore is a library agnostic JS script that will help you organize your HTML elements according to the number of columns you specify, like jQuery Masonry.

NOTE: If you jump into any trouble during a time-sensitive implementation, feel free to email rolando@bandd.co. We do not guarantee an immediate response but it would definitively be faster than using the issue tracker.

Features
--------
* __No requirements:__ Salvattore is a standalone script, it will work right away after being referenced in your HTML page.
* __Extremely lightweight:__ about 2.5KB (minified and gzipped.)
* __CSS-driven configuration:__ the number of columns is defined in CSS and the styling is left to the user.
* __Media queries ready:__ the same parameters can be used inside media queries for better results on different devices.
* __Wide browser support:__ modern browsers and IE9+ (though we're working on IE8.)

### Upcoming
* __IE8 support:__ without media queries, they aren't needed anyway.
* __Balanced columns:__ to keep all columns about the same height.
